# Neural-Network-From-Scratch-MNSIT
Built a neural network from scratch using pure Python to understand core Deep Learning mechanics. Implemented forward pass, backpropagation, activation functions (ReLU/Sigmoid), and Cross Entropy Loss manually. This project strengthened my grasp of neural network mathematics, optimization, and training dynamics.
