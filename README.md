# 🧠 Neural Network From Scratch (Pure Python)

This project implements a fully functional neural network using **pure Python**, without relying on deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The goal is to understand how neural networks actually work under the hood by building every component manually.

## 🚀 Features

* Fully connected feedforward neural network
* Manual implementation of forward propagation
* Backpropagation using the chain rule
* Gradient descent based weight updates
* Custom activation functions:
  * ReLU
  * Sigmoid
* Cross Entropy Loss implemented from scratch
* Designed for classification tasks

## 🎯 Objective

Modern ML libraries hide most of the internal mechanics of neural networks.
This project focuses on learning by building the core components manually, giving a deeper understanding of:

* How neurons compute outputs
* How gradients flow backward
* Why activation functions matter
* How loss functions guide learning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib
* No deep learning frameworks
